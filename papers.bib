  Abstract                 = {Contemporary workflow management systems are driven by explicit process models, i.e., a completely specified workflow design is required in order to enact a given workflow process. Creating a workflow design is a complicated time-consuming process and, typically, there are discrepancies between the actual workflow processes and the processes as perceived by the management. Therefore, we have developed techniques for discovering workflow models. The starting point for such techniques is a so-called "workflow log" containing information about the workflow process as it is actually being executed. We present a new algorithm to extract a process model from such a log and represent it in terms of a Petri net. However, we also demonstrate that it is not possible to discover arbitrary workflow processes. We explore a class of workflow processes that can be discovered. We show that the {\OE}$\pm$-algorithm can successfully mine any workflow represented by a so-called SWF-net.},

We present an approach for a system that constructs process models from logs of past, unstructured executions of the given process. The graph so produced conforms to the dependencies and past executions present in the log. By providing models that capture the previous executions of the process, this technique allows easier introduction of a workflow system and evaluation and evolution of existing process models. We also present results from applying the algorithm to synthetic data sets as well as process logs obtained from an IBM Flowmark installation.},

Ownership and ownership awareness are also issues in open-source software (OSS) projects. Indeed, the membership in OSS projects is dynamic with team members arriving and leaving. In large open source projects, specialists who know the system very well are considered experts. How can one identify the experts in a project by mining a particular repository like the source code? Have they gotten help from other people? We provide an approach using classification of the source code tree as a path to derive the expertise of the committers. Because committers may get help from other people, we also retrieve their contributors. We also provide a visualization that helps to further explore the repository via committers and categories. We present a prototype implementation that describes our research using the Apache HTTP Web server project as a case study.},

Large open-source developments are burdened by the rate at which new bug reports appear in the bug repository. The thesis of this work is that the task of triage can be eased by using a semi-automated approach to assign bug reports to developers. The approach consists of constructing a recommender for bug assignments; examined are both a range of algorithms that can be used and the various kinds of information provided to the algorithms. The proposed work seeks to determine through human experimentation a sufficient level of precision for the recommendations, and to analytically determine the trade-offs of the various algorithmic and information choices.},

Large open source developments are burdened by the rate at which new bug reports appear in the bug repository. In this paper, we present a semi-automated approach intended to ease one part of this process, the assignment of reports to a developer. Our approach applies a machine learning algorithm to the open bug repository to learn the kinds of reports each developer resolves. When a new report arrives, the classifier produced by the machine learning technique suggests a small number of developers suitable to resolve the report. With this approach, we have reached precision levels of 57\% and 64\% on the Eclipse and Firefox development projects respectively. We have also applied our approach to the gcc open source development with less positive results. We describe the conditions under which the approach is applicable and also report on the lessons we learned about applying machine learning to repositories used in open source development.},

  Abstract                 = {{Kent Beck's <I>eXtreme Programming eXplained</I> provides an intriguing high-level overview of the author's Extreme Programming (XP) software development methodology. Written for IS managers, project leaders, or programmers, this guide provides a glimpse at the principles behind XP and its potential advantages for small- to mid-size software development teams.<p> The book intends to describe what XP is, its guiding principles, and how it works. Simply written, the book avoids case studies and concrete details in demonstrating the efficacy of XP. Instead, it demonstrates how XP relies on simplicity, unit testing, programming in pairs, communal ownership of code, and customer input on software to motivate code improvement during the development process. As the author notes, these principles are not new, but when they're combined their synergy fosters a new and arguably better way to build and maintain software. Throughout the book, the author presents and explains these principles, such as "rapid feedback" and "play to win," which form the basis of XP.<p> Generally speaking, XP changes the way programmers work. The book is good at delineating new roles for programmers and managers who Beck calls "coaches." The most striking characteristic of XP is that programmers work in pairs, and that testing is an intrinsic part of the coding process. In a later section, the author even shows where XP works and where it doesn't and offers suggestions for migrating teams and organizations over to the XP process. <p> In the afterword, the author recounts the experiences that led him to develop and refine XP, an insightful section that should inspire any organization to adopt XP. This book serves as a useful introduction to the philosophy and practice of XP for the manager or programmer who wants a potentially better way to build software. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Extreme Programming (XP) software methodology, principles, XP team roles, facilities design, testing, refactoring, the XP software lifecycle, and adopting XP.} {Software development projects can be fun, productive, and even daring. Yet they can consistently deliver value to a business and remain under control. <P>Extreme Programming (XP) was conceived and developed to address the specific needs of software development conducted by small teams in the face of vague and changing requirements. This new lightweight methodology challenges many conventional tenets, including the long-held assumption that the cost of changing a piece of software necessarily rises dramatically over the course of time. XP recognizes that projects have to work to achieve this reduction in cost and exploit the savings once they have been earned. <P>Fundamentals of XP include: <P>* Distinguishing between the decisions to be made by business interests and those to be made by project stakeholders. * Writing unit tests before programming and keeping all of the tests running at all times. * Integrating and testing the whole system-several times a day. * Producing all software in pairs, two programmers at one screen. * Starting projects with a simple design that constantly evolves to add needed flexibility and remove unneeded complexity. * Putting a minimal system into production quickly and growing it in whatever directions prove most valuable. <P>Why is XP so controversial? Some sacred cows don't make the cut in XP: <P>* Don't force team members to specialize and become analysts, architects, programmers, testers, and integrators-every XP programmer participates in all of these critical activities every day. * Don't conduct complete up-front analysis and design-an XP project starts with a quick analysis of the entire system, and XP programmers continue to make analysis and design decisions throughout development. * Develop infrastructure and frameworks as you develop your application, not up-front-delivering business value is the heartbeat that drives XP projects. * Don't write and maintain implementation documentation-communication in XP projects occurs face-to-face, or through efficient tests and carefully written code. <P>You may love XP or you may hate it, but Extreme Programming Explained will force you to take a fresh look at how you develop software.}},

  Abstract                 = {In software development, bug reports provide crucial information to developers. However, these reports widely differ in their quality. We conducted a survey among developers and users of APACHE, ECLIPSE, and MOZILLA to find out what makes a good bug report. The analysis of the 466 responses revealed an information mismatch between what developers need and what users supply. Most developers consider steps to reproduce, stack traces, and test cases as helpful, which are at the same time most difficult to provide for users. Such insight is helpful to design new bug tracking tools that guide users at collecting and providing more helpful information. Our CUEZILLA prototype is such a tool and measures the quality of new bug reports; it also recommends which elements should be added to improve the quality. We trained CUEZILLA on a sample of 289 bug reports, rated by developers as part of the survey. In our experiments, CUEZILLA was able to predict the quality of 31--48\% of bug reports accurately.},

We anticipate that infoZilla can be used to leverage data from bug reports at a different granularity level that can facilitate interesting research in the future.},

This contradicts popular wisdom that considers bug duplicates as a serious problem for open source projects. In the survey, developers also pointed out that the additional information provided by duplicates helps to resolve bugs quicker. In this paper, we therefore propose to merge bug duplicates, rather than treating them separately. We quantify the amount of information that is added for developers and show that automatic triaging can be improved as well. In addition, we discuss the different reasons why users submit duplicate bug reports in the first place.},

OSS projects, on the other hand, use the internet as the communication medium,and typically conduct discussions in an open, public manner. As a result, the email archives of OSS projects provide a useful trace of the communication and co-ordination activities of the participants. However, there are various challenges that must be addressed before this data can be effectively mined. Once this is done, we can construct social networks of email correspondents, and begin to address some interesting questions. These include questions relating to participation in the email; the social status of different types of OSS participants; the relationship of email activity and commit activity (in the CVS repositories) and the relationship of social status with commit activity. In this paper, we begin with a discussion of our infrastructure (including a novel use of Scientific Workflow software) and then discuss our approach to mining the email archives; and finally we present some preliminary results from our data analysis.},

 relationship between different ownership measures and software faults/failures in
 three large software projects drawn from different process domains: Windows
 Vista, the Eclipse Java IDE, and the Firefox Web Browser. We find that in all
 cases, measures of ownership such as the number of low-expertise developers, and
 the proportion of ownership for the top owner have a relationship with both
 pre-release faults and post-release failures. However, we find that the strength
 of the effects is related to the development process used. Vista shows the
 strongest relationship with ownership level, followed by Eclipse, and then
 Firefox, suggesting that the more that a project uses an open source style
 process, the more that team sizes rather than ownership levels affect to
 failures. We also find reasons that low-expertise developers make changes to
 components and show that the removal of low-expertise contributions dramatically
 decreases the performance of contribution based defect prediction. Finally we
 provide recommendations for source code change policies and utilization of
 resources such as code inspections based on our results.</p>},

  abstract  = {To collect software bugs found by users, development teams often set up bug trackers using systems such as Bugzilla. Developers would then fix some of the bugs and commit corresponding code changes into version control systems such as svn or git. Unfortunately, the links between bug reports and code changes are missing for many software projects as the bug tracking and version control systems are often maintained separately. Yet, linking bug reports to fix commits is important as it could shed light into the nature of bug fixing processes and expose patterns in software management. Bug linking solutions, such as ReLink, have been proposed. The demonstration of their effectiveness however faces a number of issues, including a reliability issue with their ground truth datasets as well as the extent of their measurements. We propose in this study a benchmark for evaluating bug linking solutions. This benchmark includes a dataset of about 12,000 bug links from 10 programs. These true links between bug reports and their fixes have been provided during bug fixing processes. We designed a number of research questions, to assess both quantitatively and qualitatively the effectiveness of a bug linking tool. Finally, we apply this benchmark on ReLink to report the strengths and limitations of this bug linking tool.},

This provides for a huge amount of historical data regarding bug resolutions and new enhancement feature implementations. We discuss how software repositories can help developers in managing a new change request, either a bug or an enhancement feature. The hypothesis is that data stored in software repositories are a good descriptor on how past change requests have been resolved. Textual descriptions of fixed change requests stored in software repositories, both Bugzilla and CVS, are used to index developers and source files as documents in an information retrieval system. For a new change request, such indexes can be useful to identify the most appropriate developers to resolve it, or to predict the set of impacted source files. 1.},

In many open-source projects, such as KDE, Gnome, Mozilla, Openoffice, change requests, and related data, are stored in a bug tracking system such as Bugzilla. These data, together with the data stored in a versioning system, such as CVS, are a valuable source of information on which useful analyses can be performed. In this paper we propose a method to derive the set of source files impacted by a proposed change request. The method exploits information retrieval algorithms to link the change request description and the set of historical source file revisions impacted by similar past change requests. The method is evaluated by applying it on four open-source projects},

In this paper we propose a study on how change requests have been assigned to developers involved in an open source project and a method to suggest the set of best candidate developers to resolve a new change request. The method is based on the hypothesis that, given a new change request, developers that have resolved similar change requests in the past are the best candidates to resolve the new one. The suggestion can be useful for project managers in order to choose the best candidate to resolve a particular change request and/or to construct a competence database of developers working on software projects. We use the textual description of change requests stored in software repositories to index developers as documents in an information retrieval system. An Information Retrieval method is then applied to retrieve the candidate developers using the textual description of a new change request as a query.Case and evaluation study of the analysis and the methods introduced in this paper has been conducted on two large open source projects, Mozilla and KDE.},

The source code is first converted into an XML representation, srcML, to facilitate the use of a wide variety of XML tools. The method is deemed lightweight because only a partial parsing of the source is done. Additionally, the technique is quite robust and can be applied to incomplete and noncompilable source code. The trade off to this approach is that queries on some low level details cannot be directly addressed. This approach is applied to a fact extractor benchmark as comparison with other, heavier weight, fact extractors. Fact extractors are widely used to support understanding tasks associated with maintenance, reverse engineering and various other software engineering tasks.},

In this paper, we propose to apply machine learning techniques to assist in bug triage by using text categorization to predict the developer that should work on the bug based on the bug\^{a}s description. We demonstrate our approach on a collection of 15,859 bug reports from a large open-source project. Our evaluation shows that our prototype, using supervised Bayesian learning, can correctly predict 30 \% of the report assignments to developers. 1},

Especially in the context of software evolution a well-designed visualization is crucial to be able to cope with the sheer data that needs to be analyzed. Many approaches have been investigated to visualize evolving systems, but most of them focus on structural data and are useful to answer questions about the structural evolution of a system. In this paper we consider an often neglected type of information, namely the one provided by bug tracking systems, which store data about the problems that various people, from developers to end users, detected and reported. We first briefly introduce the context by reporting on the particularities of the present data, and then propose two visualizations to render bugs as first-level entities.},

  abstract  = {Software often crashes. Once a crash happens, a crash report could be sent to software developers for investigation upon user permission. To facilitate efficient handling of crashes, crash reports received by Microsoft's Windows Error Reporting (WER) system are organized into a set of {\quotesinglbase}{\"{A}}{\`{u}} buckets{\quotesinglbase}{\"{A}}{\`{u}}. Each bucket contains duplicate crash reports that are deemed as manifestations of the same bug. The bucket information is important for prioritizing efforts to resolve crashing bugs. To improve the accuracy of bucketing, we propose ReBucket, a method for clustering crash reports based on call stack matching. ReBucket measures the similarities of call stacks in crash reports and then assigns the reports to appropriate buckets based on the similarity values. We evaluate ReBucket using crash data collected from five widely-used Microsoft products. The results show that ReBucket achieves better overall performance than the existing methods. On average, the F-measure obtained by ReBucket is about 0.88.},

A social network represents a social structure and the underlying structural patterns can be used to analyze and comprehend how people relate to each other and their emergent behavior as a group. Developing software is fundamentally a human activity. Developers cooperate and exchange knowledge and information, creating in fact, a particular type of social network that we call knowledge network. In this paper we investigate knowledge networks in software development teams by applying social network analysis and we use the Apache web server as a case study. By analyzing the structural communication and coordination patterns in Apache we have been able to identify the Apache knowledge network, highlight potential communication bottlenecks, and find brokers and important coordination points in the software development team. Furthermore, our work enables a software architect to analyze and maintain the organization and the software architecture aligned during software evolution. An important lesson that we have is that the analysis of knowledge networks constitutes an additional tool to be added to the traditional software architecture assessment methods.

The problem is therefore noticed by the organization in charge of the maintenance, and it should be correctly and quickly dispatched to the right maintenance team. We propose to automatically classify incoming maintenance requests (also said tickets), routing them to specialized maintenance teams. The final goal is to develop a router working around the clock, that, without human intervention, dispatches incoming tickets with the lowest misclassification error, measured with respect to a given routing policy. 6000 maintenance tickets from a large, multi-site, software system, spanning about two years of system in-field operation, were used to compare and assess the accuracy of different classification approaches (i.e., Vector Space model, Bayesian model, support vectors, classification trees and k-nearest neighbor classification). The application and the tickets were divided into eight areas and pre-classified by human experts. Preliminary results were encouraging, up to 84\% of the incoming tickets were correctly classified.},

  abstract  = {Version control and bug tracking systems contain large amounts of historical information that can give deep insight into the evolution of a software project. Unfortunately, these systems provide only insufficient support for a detailed analysis of software evolution aspects. We address this problem and introduce an approach for populating a release history database that combines version data with bug tracking data and adds missing data not covered by version control systems such as merge points. Then simple queries can be applied to the structured data to obtain meaningful views showing the evolution of a software project. Such views enable more accurate reasoning of evolutionary aspects and facilitate the anticipation of software evolution. We demonstrate our approach on the large open source project Mozilla that offers great opportunities to compare results and validate our approach.},

MRs are usually stored in a configuration management or version control system and can be retrieved for analysis. In this study we retrieved the MRs from several mature open software projects. We then concentrated our analysis on those MRs that fix defects and provided heuristics to automatically classify them. We used the information in the MRs to visualize what files are changed at the same time, and who are the people who tend to modify certain files. We argue that these visualizations can be used to understand the development stage of in which a project is at a given time (new features are added, or defects are being fixed), the level of modularization of a project, and how developers might interact between each other and the source code of a system.},

We propose a model that, by combining traditional contribution metrics with data mined from software repositories, can deliver accurate developer contribution measurements. The model creates clusters of similar projects to extract weights that are then applied to the actions a developer performed on project assets to extract a combined measurement of the developer's contribution. We are currently implementing the model in the context of a software quality monitoring system while we are also validating its components by means of questionnaires.},

We found that bugs reported by people with better reputations were more likely to get fixed, as were bugs handled by people on the same team and working in geographical proximity. We reinforce these quantitative results with survey feedback from 358 Microsoft employees who were involved in Windows bugs. Survey respondents also mentioned additional qualitative influences on bug fixing, such as the importance of seniority and interpersonal skills of the bug reporter. Informed by these findings, we built a statistical model to predict the probability that a new bug will be fixed (the first known one, to the best of our knowledge). We trained it on Windows Vista bugs and got a precision of 68\% and recall of 64\% when predicting Windows 7 bug fixes. Engineers could use such a model to prioritize bugs during triage, to estimate developer workloads, and to decide which bugs should be closed or migrated to future product versions.},

Bug report reassignments, which are a common part of the bug-fixing process, have rarely been studied. In this paper, we present a large-scale quantitative and qualitative analysis of the bug reassignment process in the Microsoft Windows Vista operating system project. We quantify social interactions in terms of both useful and harmful reassignments. For instance, we found that reassignments are useful to determine the best person to fix a bug, contrary to the popular opinion that reassignments are always harmful. We categorized five primary reasons for reassignments: finding the root cause, determining ownership, poor bug report quality, hard to determine proper fix, and workload balancing. We then use these findings to make recommendations for the design of more socially-aware bug tracking systems that can overcome some of the inefficiencies we observed in our study.},

Previous qualitative research suggests that multi-site development may increase development cycle time. We use both survey data and data from the source code change management system to model the extent of delay in a multi-site software development organization, and explore several possible mechanisms for this delay. We also measure differences in same-site and cross-site communication patterns, and analyze the relationship of these variables to delay. Our results show that compared to same-site work, cross-site work takes much longer, and requires more people for work of equal size and complexity. We also report a strong relationship between delay in cross-site work and the degree to which remote colleagues are perceived to help out when workloads are heavy. We discuss implications of our findings for collaboration technology for distributed software development.},

To address this goal we performed a case study that included the manual classification of large commits of nine open source projects. The contributions include a taxonomy of large commits, which are grouped according to their intention. We contrast large commits against small commits and show that large commits are more perfective while small commits are more corrective. These large commits provide us with a window on the development practices of maintenance teams.},

  Abstract                 = {This article describes empirical research results regarding the ``history effect'' in software quality evaluation processes. Most software quality models and evaluation processes models assume that software quality may be deterministically evaluated, especially when it is evaluated by experts. Consequently, software developers focus on the technical characteristics of the software product. A similar assumption is common in most engineering disciplines. However, in regard to other kinds of goods, direct violations of the assumption about objective evaluation were shown to be affected by the consequences of cognitive processes limitations. Ongoing discussion in the area of behavioral economics raises the question: are the experts prone to observation biases? If they are, then software quality models overlook an important aspect of software quality evaluation. This article proposes an experiment that aims to trace the influence of users' knowledge on software quality assessment. Measuring the influence of single variables for the software quality perception process is a complex task. There is no valid quality model for the precise measurement of product quality, and consequently software engineering does not have tools to freely manipulate the quality level for a product. This article proposes a simplified method to manipulate the observed quality level, thereby making it possible to conduct research. The proposed experiment has been conducted among professional software evaluators. The results show the significant negative influence (large effect size) of negative experience of users on final opinion about software quality regardless of its actual level.},

A typical use of bug reports by researchers is to evaluate automated software maintenance tools: a large repository of reports is used as input for a tool, and metrics are calculated from the tool's output. But this process is quite different from practitioners, who distinguish between reports written by experts such as programmers, and reports written by non-experts such as users. Practitioners recognize that the content of a bug report depends on its author's expert knowledge. In this paper, we present an empirical study of the textual difference between bug reports written by experts and non-experts. We find that a significance difference exists, and that this difference has a significant impact on the results from a state-of-the-art feature location tool. Our recommendation is that researchers evaluate maintenance tools using different sets of bug reports for experts and non-experts.},

  Abstract                 = {bug report is typically assigned to a single developer who is then responsible for fixing the bug. In Mozilla and Eclipse, between 37\%-44\% of bug reports are "tossed" (reassigned) to other developers, for example because the bug has been assigned by accident or another developer with additional expertise is needed. In any case, tossing increases the time-to-correction for a bug. In this paper, we introduce a graph model based on Markov chains, which captures bug tossing history. This model has several desirable qualities. First, it reveals developer networks which can be used to discover team structures and to find suitable experts for a new task. Second, it helps to better assign developers to bug reports. In our experiments with 445,000 bug reports, our model reduced tossing events, by up to 72\%. In addition, the model increased the prediction accuracy by up to 23 percentage points compared to traditional bug triaging approaches.},

In particular, this survey deals with those investigations that examine multiple versions of software artifacts or other temporal information. A taxonomy is derived from the analysis of this literature and presents the work via four dimensions: the type of software repositories mined (what), the purpose (why), the adopted/invented methodology used (how), and the evaluation method (quality). The taxonomy is demonstrated to be expressive (i.e., capable of representing a wide spectrum of MSR investigations) and effective (i.e., facilitates similarities and comparisons of MSR investigations). Lastly, a number of open research issues in MSR that require further investigation are identified.},

  abstract  = {The paper presents an approach to recommend a ranked list of expert developers to assist in the implementation of software change requests (e.g., bug reports and feature requests). An Information Retrieval (IR)-based concept location technique is first used to locate source code entities, e.g., files and classes, relevant to a given textual description of a change request. The previous commits from version control repositories of these entities are then mined for expert developers. The role of the IR method in selectively reducing the mining space is different from previous approaches that textually index past change requests and/or commits. The approach is evaluated on change requests from three open-source systems: ArgoUML, Eclipse, and KOffice, across a range of accuracy criteria. The results show that the overall accuracies of the correctly recommended developers are between 47 and 96\% for bug reports, and between 43 and 60\% for feature requests. Moreover, comparison results with two other recommendation alternatives show that the presented approach outperforms them with a substantial margin. Project leads or developers can use this approach in maintenance tasks immediately after the receipt of a change request in a free-form text. Copyright {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Much of software developers' time is spent understanding unfamiliar code. To better understand how developers gain this understanding and how software development environments might be involved, a study was performed in which developers were given an unfamiliar program and asked to work on two debugging tasks and three enhancement tasks for 70 minutes. The study found that developers interleaved three activities. They began by searching for relevant code both manually and using search tools; however, they based their searches on limited and misrepresentative cues in the code, environment, and executing program, often leading to failed searches. When developers found relevant code, they followed its incoming and outgoing dependencies, often returning to it and navigating its other dependencies; while doing so, however, Eclipse's navigational tools caused significant overhead. Developers collected code and other information that they believed would be necessary to edit, duplicate, or otherwise refer to later by encoding it in the interactive state of Eclipse's package explorer, file tabs, and scroll bars. However, developers lost track of relevant code as these interfaces were used for other tasks, and developers were forced to find it again. These issues caused developers to spend, on average, 35 percent of their time performing the mechanics of navigation within and between source files. These observations suggest a new model of program understanding grounded in theories of information foraging and suggest ideas for tools that help developers seek, relate, and collect information in a more effective and explicit manner.},

  abstract  = {Global and distributed software development increases the need to find and connect developers with relevant expertise. Existing recommendation systems typically model expertise based on file changes (implementation expertise). While these approaches have shown success, they require a substantial recorded history of development for a project. Previously, we have proposed the concept of usage expertise, i.e., expertise manifested through the act of calling (using) a method. In this paper, we assess the viability of this concept by evaluating expert recommendations for the ASPECTJ and ECLIPSE projects. We find that both usage and implementation expertise have comparable levels of accuracy, which suggests that usage expertise may be used as a substitute measure. We also find a notable overlap of method calls across both projects, which suggests that usage expertise can be leveraged to recommend experts from different projects and thus for projects with little or no history.},

Part of the bug triage is the assignment of a report to a developer with the appropriate expertise. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically suggest developers who have the appropriate expertise for handling a bug report. We model developer expertise using the vocabulary found in their source code contributions and compare this vocabulary to the vocabulary of bug reports. We evaluate our approach by comparing the suggested experts to the persons who eventually worked on the bug. Using eight years of Eclipse development as a case study, we achieve 33.6\% top-1 precision and 71.0\% top-10 recall.},

  Abstract                 = {Finding relevant expertise is a critical need in collaborative software engineering, particularly in geographically distributed developments. We introduce a tool that uses data from change management systems to locate people with desired expertise. It uses a quantification of experience, and presents evidence to validate this quantification as a measure of expertise. The tool enables developers, for example, easily to distinguish someone who has worked only briefly in a particular area of the code from someone who has more extensive experience, and to locate people with broad expertise throughout large parts of the product, such as module or even subsystems. In addition, it allows a user to discover expertise profiles for individuals or organizations. Data from a deployment of the tool in a large software development organization shows that newer, remote sites tend to use the tool for expertise location more frequently. Larger, more established sites used the tool to find expertise profiles for people or organizations. We conclude by describing extensions that provide continuous awareness of ongoing work and an interactive, quantitative resume.},

The most successful approaches have been proven to be the ones combining TR techniques with static analysis, dynamic analysis, and/or software repositories information. Dynamic software analysis and software repositories mining bring a significant overhead, as they require instrumenting and executing the software, and analyzing large amounts of data, respectively. We propose a new static technique, named Lobster (Locating Bugs using Stack Traces and text Retrieval), which is meant to improve TR-based bug localization without the overhead associated with dynamic analysis and repository mining. Specifically, we use the stack traces submitted in a bug report to compute the similarity between their code elements and the source code of a software system. We combine the stack trace based similarity and the textual similarity provided by TR techniques to retrieve code elements relevant to bug reports. We empirically evaluated Lobster using 155 bug reports containing stack traces from 14 open source software systems. We used Lucene, an optimized version of VSM, as baseline of comparison. The results show that, in average, Lobster improves or maintains the effectiveness of Lucene-based bug localization in 82% of the cases.},

Estimation of work time to fix a bug is commonly used to support this process. This research explores the viability of using data mining tools to predict the time to fix a bug given only the basic information known at the beginning of a bug's lifetime. To address this question, a historical portion of the Eclipse Bugzilla database is used for modeling and predicting bug lifetimes. A bug history transformation process is described and several data mining models are built and tested. Interesting behaviours derived from the models are documented. The models can correctly predict up to 34.9\% of the bugs into a discretized log scaled lifetime class.},

  abstract  = {Despite its vast capacity and associative powers, the human brain does not deal well with interruptions. Particularly in situations where information density is high, such as during a programming task, recovering from an interruption requires extensive time and effort. Although modern program development environments have begun to recognize this problem, none of these tools take into account the brain's structure and limitations. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of human memory, particularly with respect to it ability to deal with work interruptions. The framework explains empirical results obtained from experiments in which programmers were interrupted while working. Based on the framework, we discuss programmer information needs that development tools must satisfy and suggest several memory aids such tools could provide. We also describe our prototype implementation of these memory aids.},

A classification strategy is presented that involves the use of supervised and unsupervised pattern classification and multivariate visualization. These techniques are applied to profiles of failed executions in order to group together failures with the same or similar causes. The resulting classification is then used to assess the frequency and severity of failures caused by particular defects and to help diagnose those defects. The results of applying the proposed classification strategy to failures of three large subject programs are reported These results indicate that the strategy can be effective.},

In the proposed approach, LSI is used to map the concepts expressed in queries written by the programmer to relevant parts of the source code, presented as a ranked list of search results. Given the ranked list of source code elements, our approach selects most relevant attributes from these documents and organizes the results in a concept lattice, generated via FCA. The approach is evaluated in a case study on concept location in the source code of eclipse, an industrial size integrated development environment. The results of the case study show that the proposed approach is effective in organizing different concepts and their relationships present in the subset of the search results. The proposed concept location method outperforms the simple ranking of the search results, reducing the programmers' effort.},

  abstract    = {Defect reports are generated from various testing and development activities in software engineering. Sometimes two reports are submitted that describe the same problem, leading to duplicate reports. These reports are mostly written in structured natural language, and as such, it is hard to compare two reports for similarity with formal methods. In order to identify duplicates, we investigate using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to support the identification. A prototype tool is developed and evaluated in a case study analyzing defect reports at Sony Ericsson mobile communications. The evaluation shows that about 2/3 of the duplicates can possibly be found using the NLP techniques. Different variants of the techniques provide only minor result differences, indicating a robust technology. User testing shows that the overall attitude towards the technique is positive and that it has a growth potential.},

Existing expertise recommendation systems are mostly based on variations of the Line 10 Rule: developers who changed a file most often have the most implementation expertise. In this paper, we introduce the concept of usage expertise, which manifests itself whenever developers are using functionality, e.g., by calling API methods. We present preliminary results for the ECLIPSE project that demonstrate that our technique allows to recommend experts for files with no or little history, identify developers with similar expertise, and measure the usage of API methods.},

  Abstract                 = {IT problem management calls for quick identification of resolvers to reported problems. The efficiency of this process highly depends on ticket routing---transferring problem ticket among various expert groups in search of the right resolver to the ticket. To achieve efficient ticket routing, wise decision needs to be made at each step of ticket transfer to determine which expert group is likely to be, or to lead to the resolver. In this paper, we address the possibility of improving ticket routing efficiency by mining ticket resolution sequences alone, without accessing ticket content. To demonstrate this possibility, a Markov model is developed to statistically capture the right decisions that have been made toward problem resolution, where the order of the Markov model is carefully chosen according to the conditional entropy obtained from ticket data. We also design a search algorithm, called Variable-order Multiple active State search(VMS), that generates ticket transfer recommendations based on our model. The proposed framework is evaluated on a large set of real-world problem tickets. The results demonstrate that VMS significantly improves human decisions: Problem resolvers can often be identified with fewer ticket transfers.},

  Abstract                 = {In several organizations, it has become increasingly popular to document and log the steps that makeup a typical business process. In some situations, a normative workflow model of such processes is developed, and it becomes important to know if such a model is actually being followed by analyzing the available activity logs. In other scenarios, no model is available and, with the purpose of evaluating cases or creating new production policies, one is interested in learning a workflow representation of such activities. In either case, machine learning tools that can mine workflow models are of great interest and still relatively unexplored. We present here a probabilistic workflow model and a corresponding learning algorithm that runs in polynomial time. We illustrate the algorithm on example data derived from a real world workflow.},

It is a technique used to preprocess data so that subsequent time series analysis on individual segments can detect trends that may not be evident when performing time series analysis on the entire dataset. This technique allows data miners to partition a large dataset without making any assumption of periodicity or any other a priori knowledge of the dataset's features. We investigate the insights that can be gained from the application of time series segmentation to software version repositories. Software version repositories from large projects contain on the order of hundreds of thousands of timestamped entries or more. It is a continuing challenge to aggregate such data so that noise is reduced and important characteristics are brought out. In this paper, we present a way to summarize developer work history in terms of the files they have modified over time by segmenting the CVS change data of individual Eclipse developers. We show that the files they modify tends to change significantly over time though most of them tend to work within the same directories.},

  abstract  = {Software developers, particularly in open-source projects, rely on bug repositories to organize their work. On a bug report, the component field is used to indicate to which team of developers a bug should be routed. Researchers have shown that incorrect categorization of newly received bug reports to components can cause potential delays in the resolution of bug reports. Approaches have been developed that consider the use of machine learning approaches, specifically Support Vector Machines (svm), to automatically categorize bug reports into the appropriate component to help streamline the process of solving a bug. One drawback of an SVM-based approach is that the results of categorization can be uneven across various components in the system if some components receive less reports than others. In this paper, we consider broadening the consistency of the recommendations produced by an automatic approach by investigating three approaches to automating bug report categorization: an approach similar to previous ones based on an SVM classifier and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency(svm-tf-idf), an approach using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with SVM (svm-lda) and an approach using LDA and Kullback Leibler divergence (lda-kl). We found that lda-kl produced recalls similar to those found previously but with better consistency across all components for which bugs must be categorized.},

These ExpertiseNets are used for mining, retrieval, and visualization. We conduct experiments by building ExpertiseNets for researchers from a research paper collection. The experiments demonstrate that expertise mining and matching are more efficiently achieved based on the proposed relational and evolutionary graph models.},

  Abstract                 = {An open source project typically maintains an open bug repository so that bug reports from all over the world can be gathered. When a new bug report is submitted to the repository, a person, called a triager, examines whether it is a duplicate of an existing bug report. If it is, the triager marks it as DUPLICATE and the bug report is removed from consideration for further work. In the literature, there are approaches exploiting only natural language information to detect duplicate bug reports. In this paper we present a new approach that further involves execution information. In our approach, when a new bug report arrives, its natural language information and execution information are compared with those of the existing bug reports. Then, a small number of existing bug reports are suggested to the triager as the most similar bug reports to the new bug report. Finally, the triager examines the suggested bug reports to determine whether the new bug report duplicates an existing bug report. We calibrated our approach on a subset of the Eclipse bug repository and evaluated our approach on a subset of the Firefox bug repository. The experimental results show that our approach can detect 67\%-93\% of duplicate bug reports in the Firefox bug repository, compared to 43\%-72\% using natural language information alone.},

We present an approach that automatically predicts the fixing effort, i.e., the person-hours spent on fixing an issue. Our technique leverages existing issue tracking systems: given a new issue report, we use the Lucene framework to search for similar, earlier reports and use their average time as a prediction. Our approach thus allows for early effort estimation, helping in assigning issues and scheduling stable releases. We evaluated our approach using effort data from the JBoss project. Given a sufficient number of issues reports, our automatic predictions are close to the actual effort; for issues that are bugs, we are off by only one hour, beating na\^{A}$\neg${\textregistered}\'{y}ve predictions by a factor of four.},

As in every major project tasks are assigned to many developers, the development must be coordinated between these programmers. This paper describes three visualization techniques that help to examine how programmers work together, e.g. if they work as a team or if they develop their part of the software separate from each other. Furthermore, phases of stagnation in the lifetime of a project can be uncovered and thus, possible problems are revealed. To demonstrate the usefulness of these visualization techniques we performed case studies on two open source projects. In these studies interesting patterns of developers' behavior, e.g. the specialization on a certain module can be observed. Moreover, modules that have been changed by many developers can be identified as well as such ones that have been altered by only one programmer.},

  abstract  = {To deal with post-release bugs, many software projects set up public bug repositories for users all over the world to report bugs that they have encountered. Recently, researchers have proposed various information retrieval based approaches to localizing faults based on bug reports. In these approaches, source files are processed as single units, where noise in large files may affect the accuracy of fault localization. Furthermore, bug reports often contain stack-trace information, but existing approaches often treat this information as plain text. In this paper, we propose to use segmentation and stack-trace analysis to improve the performance of bug localization. Specifically, given a bug report, we divide each source code file into a series of segments and use the segment most similar to the bug report to represent the file. We also analyze the bug report to identify possible faulty files in a stack trace and favor these files in our retrieval. According to our empirical results, our approach is able to significantly improve Bug Locator, a representative fault localization approach, on all the three software projects (i.e., Eclipse, AspectJ, and SWT) used in our empirical evaluation. Furthermore, segmentation and stack-trace analysis are complementary to each other for boosting the performance of bug-report-oriented fault localization.},

This is reasonable in batch settings, but it is not reasonable when data are revealed over time, as is the case with streaming / online algorithms. To address this lacuna, we extend LDA by drawing topics from a Dirichlet process whose base distribution is a distribution over all strings rather than from a finite Dirichlet. We develop inference using online variational inference and because we only can consider a finite number of words for each truncated topic propose heuristics to dynamically organize, expand, and contract the set of words we consider in our vocabulary truncation. We show our model can successfully incorporate new words as it encounters new terms and that it performs better than online LDA in evaluations of topic quality and classification performance.},

In the literature, both dynamic and interactive approaches have been proposed for feature location. In this paper, we present a static and non-interactive method for achieving this objective. The main idea of our approach is to use the information retrieval (IR) technology to reveal the basic connections between features and computational units in source code. Due to the characteristics of the retrieved connections, we use a static representation of the source code named BRCG to further recover both the relevant and the specific computational units for each feature. Furthermore, we recover the relationships among the relevant units for each feature. A premise of our approach is that programmers should use meaningful names as identifiers. We perform an experimental study based on a GNU system to evaluate our approach. In the experimental study, we present the detailed quantitative experimental data and give the qualitative analytical results.},

  abstract = {Abstract Several issues or defects in released software during the maintenance phase are reported to the development team. It is costly and time-consuming for developers to precisely localize bugs. Bug reports and the code change history are frequently used and provide information for identifying fault locations during the software maintenance phase. It is difficult to standardize the style of bug reports written in natural languages to improve the accuracy of bug localization. The objective of this paper is to propose an effective information retrieval-based bug localization method to find suspicious files and methods for resolving bugs. In this paper, we propose a novel information retrieval-based bug localization approach, termed Bug Localization using Integrated Analysis (BLIA). Our proposed BLIA integrates analyzed data by utilizing texts, stack traces and comments in bug reports, structured information of source files, and the source code change history. We improved the granularity of bug localization from the file level to the method level by extending previous bug repository data. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach based on experiments using three open-source projects, namely AspectJ, SWT, and ZXing. In terms of the mean average precision, on average our approach improves the metric of BugLocator, BLUiR, BRTracer, AmaLgam and the preliminary version of BLIA by 54%, 42%, 30%, 25% and 15%, respectively, at the file level of bug localization. Compared with prior tools, the results showed that BLIA outperforms these other methods. We analyzed the influence of each score of BLIA from various combinations based on the analyzed information. Our proposed enhancement significantly improved the accuracy. To improve the granularity level of bug localization, a new approach at the method level is proposed and its potential is evaluated.},

  abstract = {Bug triage is a critical advance during the time spent bug settling. The objective of bug triage is to appoint another coming bug to the right potential designer. The current bug triage approaches depend on machine learning calculations, which assemble classifiers from the preparation sets of bug reports. By and by, these methodologies experience the ill effects of the extensive scale and low-quality preparing sets. In this paper, we propose the preparation set diminished with both component choice and occurrence determination strategies for bug triage. We consolidate include choice with occurrence determination to enhance the exactness of bug triage. The component choice calculation, occurrence determination calculation Iterative Case Filter, and their mixes are examined in this paper. We assess the preparation set lessening on the bug information of Eclipse. For the preparation set, 70% words and half bug reports are evacuated after the preparation set lessening. The exploratory outcomes demonstrate that the new and little preparing sets can give preferred precision over the first one.

  abstract  = {Code review is of primary importance in modern software development. It is widely recognized that peer review is an efficient and effective practice for improving software quality and reducing defect proneness. For successful review process, peer reviewers should have a deep experience and knowledge with the code being reviewed, and familiar to work and collaborate together. However, one of the main challenging tasks in modern code review is to find the most appropriate reviewers for submitted code changes. So far, reviewers assignment is still a manual, costly and time-consuming task. In this paper, we introduce a search-based approach, namely RevRec, to provide decision-making support for code change submitters and/or reviewers assigners to identify most appropriate peer reviewers for their code changes. RevRec aims at finding reviewers to be assigned for a code change based on their expertise and collaboration in past reviews using genetic algorithm (GA). We evaluated our approach on a benchmark of three open-source software systems, Android, OpenStack, and Qt. Results indicate that RevRec accurately recommends code reviewers with up to 59% of precision and 74% of recall. Our experiments provide evidence that leveraging reviewers expertise from their prior reviews and the socio-technical aspects of the team work and collaboration is relevant in improving the performance of peer reviewers recommendation in modern code review.},
